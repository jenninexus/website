### Hi there, Jenni here - Technical artist, game dev, streamer.

Nice to meet you! The Live Coders are an amazing, diverse team that I'm grateful to be on.

My passion is for learning 3d modeling for graphic designs and game art, Unity to make games, and currently building my [portfolio](https://jenninexus.com/portfolio). I started my Youtube channel back in 2012, and when I discovered Twitch a year later I hopped on board. By January 2017, I was streaming regularly, and I continue to stream a couple times / week. Usually I'll be streaming in the Creative or Science & Tech sections but I make sure to take time to play really awesome games that come out, as well as indie games, which I like to feature on Youtube as well.

When I'm not gaming, or building my digital art skills, I'm playing with my cat (13 yrs old), making dank food, or hula hooping. I also have a t-shirt shredding hobby. :-D
